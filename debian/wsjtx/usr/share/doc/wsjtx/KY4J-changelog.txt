    Fixed SIGSEGV when 2khz checkbox is checked.  Thanks to John Nelson, G4KLA for going to the extra trouble to
    show me how to fix the problem.  Problem was psk_Reporter was being declared in wrong place.
    Also removed #IFDEF unix around psk_Reporter.
    This is now Debian version "1.1.1r3520-3+Wheezy".

    Brute force fix of Segfault when 2khz checkbox is set.
    In mainwindow.cpp, Plus2kHz is now forced to false on every program start.
          settings.setValue("Plus2Khz", "false");
    This is fixed in later upstream releases.
